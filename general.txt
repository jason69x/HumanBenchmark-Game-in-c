One day Jimmy Westfielder was walking home from school and saw a big brown dog walking behind him At first he was a bit startled at the fact that the dog was just calmly walking behind him Jimmy stopped and turned around to face the dog  When Jimmy looked into the dogs eyes he became  Cognizant that the dog meant no harm at all Jimmy bent down to the dogs level and put one of his hands out As soon as Jimmy did so the dog began to lick  Jimmys hand Jimmy then checked to see if the dog had a collar which he didnt and when he didnt find a collar he then said Hello my name is Jimmy
